# RosieBot

## Chatbot for Twitch build with Node.js

### Ideas

[x] !dice for rolling dice :P
[ ] Rosie quotes, if I can find them (they are hard to find, guess I'll have to watch episodes again)
[ ] Connect to SoundByte, maybe through MIDI
[ ] Connect to Azure Machine Learning
[ ] request information about the codebase working on, like lines of code or current issue
[ ] Do something with hardware/IoT/Arduino
[ ] Trigger stuff in the stream, in browser windows in OBS

### Commands

[ ] !uptime https://api.twitch.tv/helix/streams/
[ ] social links, !twitter, !discord, !youtube, !insta
[ ] !toolset
[ ] !editor
[ ] code metrics
    !build for build status
    !loc for lines of code
