Sfx:
    ✘ !delight sfx (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUqvPJ3cbUQ) @cancelled(20-06-25 17:27)
    ☐ Add more ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1E10Tbsw68
    ☐ sfx back to the future

Thoughts and rough ideas:
    ☐ Build a game or something where people can send `code` to Rosie and have her execute it to play a game.
        Secretmud: Maybe make RosieScript?

New Architecture:
    The new architecture will be based on plugins. Core will provide UI, 
    a connection to Twitch (maybe other services) and an API to connect the
    plugins to.
    ☐ implement RFC-1149
    ☐ default config installed when running for the first time.
    ~ https://twitch.c0dr.nl:9384/webhook/tts-send/Welcome to the channel!

    ☐ Improve for loops to `for(const event of events)` where possible.

    core:
        Config:
            ☐ Add a toggle for all triggers to disabled them if needed

    plugins:
        ☐ @critical dynamically load plugins from disk
        ☐ add a store for plugins

        triggers and actions
        Stuff plugins can do;
            = notifications
            = UI in column (300px wide)
            = UI full screen
            = Overlays for OBS
            = Listen for Twitch Events
            = Listen for Chat messages
            = Communicate between overlay and internal code
            = Have a simple lifecycle
    
    Triggers:
        ☐ Rosie Started
            ~ to initialize some things
        ☐ Shoutout
        ☐ TwitchEvents 'native'
        ☐ Vote
        ✔ On scene switch @done(20-05-27 12:18)
            ~ for example to stop the music when the opening starts

    Actions:
        ☐ @high VariableAction 
            => this is also the basis for variable commands like !project
            => maybe they should have a UI as well.
            => broadcaster can set response of action during stream, like `!beer` or `!project`
        ☐ AddCommandAction
        ☐ AnimationAction
            => Sequences of actions with time
            -> could be the delay action in combination with multiaction

    To convert from old to new:
        overlays:
            ☐ @critical end stream credits
                ~ Create Azure Webhook to Websocket relay first
        chat commands:
            ☐ @low beer
            ☐ @low blame
            ☐ @low command
            ☐ followage
            !light:
                ☐ hype
            ☐ lurk
                ~ difficulty is that right now an action has no knowledge of the context 
                  and doesn't know WHO typed the command.
            ☐ muted
            ☐ @critical project
                ~ probably needs to have `VariableAction` implemented as well
            ☐ so
            ☐ social
            ☐ (song)
            ☐ theme
            ☐ @high uptime
            ☐ !addToToDoList
