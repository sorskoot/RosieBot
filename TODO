New Architecture:
    The new architecture will be based on plugins. Core will provide UI, 
    a connection to Twitch (maybe other services) and an API to connect the
    plugins to.

    core:
        UI:
            UI will be responsive in column (+/- 300px wide)

    plugins:
        triggers and actions
        Stuff plugins can do;
            = notifications
            = UI in column (300px wide)
            = UI full screen
            = Overlays for OBS
            = Listen for Twitch Events
            = Listen for Chat messages
            = Communicate between overlay and internal code
            = Have a simple lifecycle
